    BaseGeometry Class

    A base class for geometry-related operations. It defines a placeholder
    method for calculating the area of a geometric shape.

    Methods:
        area(): Placeholder method for calculating the area of a shape.

    Usage:
        geometry = BaseGeometry()

        This method is a placeholder for calculating the area of a geometric
        shape. It raises an exception since it is not implemented in this
        base class.

        Raises:
            Exception: This method is not implemented in the base class.

        Usage:
